Showcases (homework assighnment for Data Analytics Boorcamp) ability to create simple Python scripts through Visual Studio Code including how:
- import modules like `csv`; 
- to read and write files in various formats; 
- to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; 
- to iterate through basic data structures; and to debug along the way. 

## PyBank

* Analysis of the financial records (Excel) of a company. 

* Created Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll
